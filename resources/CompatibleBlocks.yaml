  summary: Get compatible blocks in a workflow
  description: >-
    Validates if a block added to a workflow is compatible
    with the other blocks of that workflow. If no parent or child
    blocks (workflow tasks) are given, then all blocks that have empty input
    capabilities are returned.
  operationId: GetCompatibleBlocks
  parameters:
  - name: project_id
    in: path
    required: true
    schema:
      $ref: '../schemas/ProjectID.yaml'
  - name: workflow_id
    in: path
    required: true
    schema:
      $ref: '../schemas/WorkflowID.yaml'
  - name: parentTaskName
    in: query
    schema:
      type: string
      example: sobloo-s1-grd-aoiclipped:1
    description: >-
      The first workflow task that will be the parent of the next task added in the
      workflow. Adding multiple parents is currently not possible.
  - name: childTaskName
    in: query
    schema:
      type: string
      example: tiling:1
    description: >-
      The workflow task that will be the child of the previous task from the
      workflow. Multiple children can be provided by repeating the
      parameter. Adding multiple children is possible when the workflow is a tree,
      i.e., a given node in the directed graph representing the workflow has a unique path 
      for more than one node. Example: a workflow where a data block
      feeds into multiple processing blocks, leveraging parallel
      processing.
